## Outline

- Part 6 - Write a Sample Web Application with forms

## Part 1 - Getting to know routing and HTTP URLs.

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a request-response protocol. A client on one side (web browser) asks or requests something from a server and the server on the other side sends a response to that client. When we open our browser and write down the URL (Uniform Resource Locator), we are requesting a resource from a server and the URL is the address of that resource. The structure of typical URL is as the following.

![URL anatomy](./url-structure.png)

The server responds to that request with an HTTP response message. Within the response, a status code element is a 3-digit integer defines the category of response as shown below.

- 1xx -> Informational ---> It means the request was received and the process is continuing.

- 2xx -> Success ---> It means the action was successfully received, understood, and accepted.

- 3xx -> Redirection ---> It means further action must be taken in order to complete the request.

- 4xx -> Client Error ---> It means the request contains incorrect syntax or cannot be fulfilled.

- 5xx -> Server Error ---> It means the server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request.

If you would learn those codes one by one. I can sent you a URL. You can also find different resources.

## Part 2 - Getting to know HTTP methods (GET & POST)

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a request-response protocol. A client on one side (web browser) asks or requests something from a server and the server on the other side sends a response to that client. 

When sending request, the client can send data with using different http methods like `GET, POST, PUT, HEAD, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS`, but the most common ones are `GET` and `POST`.

![Get and Post Requests](./get-post-request.jpg)

- HTTP `GET` method request;
    
    - used to request data from a specified resource.

    - can be cached.

    - remains in the browser history.

    - can be bookmarked

    - should never be used when dealing with sensitive data.

    - has length limitation.

    - only used to request data, not to modify it. 

- HTTP `POST` method request;
    
    - never cached.

    - does not remain in the browser history.

    - can not be bookmarked

    - can be used when dealing with sensitive data.

    - has no length limitation.

## Part 3 - Write a Web Application using If conditions and for loops

- Copy `flask-03-handling-routes-and-if-for` within `my-repository` repo

- Under `Flask_If_for_structure` folder within `flask-03-handling-routes-and-if-for` repo

- Create python file named `app.py`

```python
# Import Flask modules

# Create an object named app 


# Create a function named head which shows the massage as "This is my first conditions experience" in `index.html` 
# and assign to the route of ('/')


# Create a function named header which prints numbers elements of list one by one in `index.html` 
# and assign to the route of ('/')

#Â run this app in debug mode on your local.

```

## Part 4 - Write a Web Application with Sample Routings and Templating on GitHub Repo

- Let's head over `flask-03-handling-routes` folder within `flask-03-handling-routes-and-if-for` repo

- Create python file named `app.py`

```python
#Import Flask modules

#Create an object named app 


# Create a function named home which returns a string 'This is home page for no path, <h1> Welcome Home</h1>' 
# and assign route of no path ('/')


# Create a function named about which returns a formatted string '<h1>This is my about page </h1>' 
# and assign to the static route of ('about')


# Create a function named error which returns a formatted string '<h1>Either you encountered an error or you are not authorized.</h1>' 
# and assign to the static route of ('error')


# Create a function named admin which redirect the request to the error path 
# and assign to the route of ('/admin')


# Create a function named greet which return formatted inline html string 
# and assign to the dynamic route of ('/<name>')


# Create a function named greet_admin which redirect the request to the hello path with param of 'Master Admin!!!!' 
# and assign to the route of ('/greet-admin')


# Rewrite a function named greet which uses template file named `greet.html` under `templates` folder 
# and assign to the dynamic route of ('/<name>'). 
# Please find a template html file named `greet.html` which takes `name` as parameter under `templates` folder 


# Create a function named list10 which creates a list counting from 1 to 10 within `list10.html` 
# and assign to the route of ('/list10'). 
# Please find a template html file named `list10.html` which shows a list counting from 1 to 10 under `templates` folder 


# Create a function named evens which show the even numbers from 1 to 10 within `evens.html` 
# and assign to the route of ('/evens'). 
# Please find a template html file named `evens.html` which shows a list of even numbers from 1 to 10 under `templates` folder 


# Add a statement to run the Flask application which can be reached from any host on port 80.
```

## Part 5 - Learn to use GET and POST HTTP Method

- Go to `Flask_GET_POST_Methods` folder under the `flask-04-handling-forms-POST-GET-Methods` folder

- Create file named `app.py`  here. 

```python
# Import Flask modules


# Create an object named app


# create a function named "lcm" which calculates a least common multiple values of two numbers. 


# Create a function named `index` which uses template file named `index.html` 
# send two numbers as template variable to the app.py and assign route of no path ('/') 


# calculate sum of them using "lcm" function, then sent the result to the 
# "result.hmtl" file and assign route of path ('/calc'). 
# When the user comes directly "/calc" path, "Since this is a GET request, LCM has not been calculated" string returns to them with "result.html" file


# Add a statement to run the Flask application which can be debugged.

```

## Part 6 - Write a Sample Web Application with forms

- Go to `flask-04-handling-forms` within `flask-04-handling-forms-POST-GET-Methods` folder

- Now, we'll write an application with form handling and save the complete code as `app-form-handling.py` under `flask-04-handling-forms` folder.

```python
# Import Flask modules


# Create an object named app


# Write a function named `greet` which uses template file named `greet.html` given under 
# `templates` folder. it takes parameters from query string on URL, assign that parameter 
# to the 'user' variable and sent that user name into the html file. If it doesn't have any parameter, warning massage is raised



# Write a function named `greet` which uses template file named `greet.html` given under `templates` folder


# Write a function named `login` which uses `GET` and `POST` methods, 
# and template files named `login.html` and `secure.html` given under `templates` folder 
# and assign to the static route of ('login')


# Add a statement to run the Flask application which can be reached from any host on port 80.


# app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=80)
```
